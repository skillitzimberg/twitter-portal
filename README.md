## Summary

This the seventh app on my roadmap part of the Software Development Mastermind program. This a reintroduction to .NET Core and C# for me. I appreciate how easy .NET makes it to set up a web app & API. The most difficult part of the project was understanding Twitter's v2 API.

The expectations for the project are described in [DELIVERABLES](./DELIVERABLES.md).

The steps I took and other errata encountered while building are in [PLANNING](./PLANNING.md). I tried my best to have the commits track closely with this document.
